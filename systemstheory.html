          superdeterminism and quantum mechanics</a>. P1 critiques superdeterminism for erasing the present. P2 proposes a dual-aspect
          theory where collapse happens both in the physical world and in conscious modelling. Future work will extend these
          ideas by connecting biology with conscious experience, will and the scope for spirituality.

          <strong>Summary:</strong> This essay argues that superdeterminism, while formally consistent, erases the ontological
          role of the present and ignores the cognitive complexity of real observers. It critiques superdeterminism for
          treating all outcomes as fixed from the past, and proposes that any adequate theory must preserve the present as
          the locus where constraint and possibility meet in temporally and cognitively structured systems.

          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>
            Superdeterminism has re-emerged as a radical alternative to conventional quantum interpretations, purporting to
            resolve nonlocality and the measurement problem by denying statistical independence between measurement settings
            and system variables. While mathematically coherent, this position rests on a metaphysical asymmetry: it privileges
            the past as a fixed structure while ignoring the constitutive role of the present and the epistemic openness of the
            future. In this article, I argue that such models fail to account for the dynamical nature of measurement as a
            temporally embedded, cognitively mediated act. Drawing on insights from time-symmetric quantum formulations,
            neuroscience, and complexity theory, I propose that any viable physical theory must preserve the ontological
            distinctiveness of the present as a locus where constraint and possibility meet. Superdeterminism, in contrast,
            renders the present epiphenomenal and collapses possibility into determinacy. This framework risks explanatory
            sterility and conceptual circularity, and I offer reasons to consider it incomplete without a more nuanced theory
            of time and cognition.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            The quantum measurement problem and the appearance of nonlocality have motivated various interpretations of quantum
            mechanics. Among them, superdeterminism has gained renewed attention, largely through proponents such as Sabine
            Hossenfelder (2020), who argue that Bell’s theorem can be circumvented by denying the independence of measurement
            settings from hidden variables. This implies that the apparent randomness in quantum events is illusory: every
            event, including experimental choices, was determined from the universe’s initial conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
             While this position is internally consistent, I argue that it is ontologically impoverished and epistemically
             fragile. Superdeterminism treats the past as fully real, the future as non-contributory, and the present as merely
             derivative. This temporal asymmetry undermines the very framework it seeks to strengthen. Further, it neglects the
             cognitive complexity and adaptive unpredictability of systems like the brain, which reshape the topology of the
             future in ways irreducible to past causes.

        <p class="paper-summary">
          <strong>Summary:</strong> This essay develops a dual-aspect theory of collapse, arguing that quantum events resolve
          physically through decoherence and experientially through inferential updates in conscious models. It reframes the
          present as the convergence point of a constrained past and an open future, and proposes that only by combining
          physical and conscious layers can we make sense of how reality becomes both determinate and experienced.

          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>
            Wavefunction collapse in quantum mechanics has long been a site of conceptual confusion, with competing
            interpretations either removing the observer entirely or attributing mystical powers to consciousness.
            Here, we propose a dual-aspect framework that reconciles collapse as a physical process with collapse as
            a psychological reality. We argue that collapse occurs both outside and inside of consciousness:
            externally, as entanglement and decoherence; internally, as the point at which information becomes
            integrated into a modelling system. These two forms of collapse are not mutually exclusive but
            structurally necessary to account for the emergence of experienced reality. The present is reframed as the
            convergence point between a deterministic past and a probabilistic future. We further contend that both
            physical and conscious systems are endpoint manifestations, structured through brain connectivity, of a
            larger informational reality. This account offers a reconciliatory path forward in physics and
            consciousness studies, grounded in contemporary neuroscience, quantum theory, and temporal dynamics.
